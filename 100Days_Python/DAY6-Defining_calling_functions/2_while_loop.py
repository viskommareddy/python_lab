while loops are dangerous when compared with for loops

---FOR 

for item in list_of_items:
#Do something to each item

for number in range(a,b):
print(number)

this means for loop runs untill the limits of a list or a range


---While

While somehting _is_true:
#Do something repeatedly

while loop runs untill the condition turns false

---Infinite Loop

Ex:

While 5>3:

    do this 
    them do this
    finally do this
