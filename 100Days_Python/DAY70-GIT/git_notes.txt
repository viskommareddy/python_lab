    if working on a project / program /code and to which we save it at multiple save points,these save points
are the different versions of the code/program.SUppose, in case the final code whichn is finished turned out 
to be wrong, we dont need to develop it from scratch. Instead, we can start from a particular version(save point)

    note that, the current version can also be compared with the previous versions to reflect the changes.
and we can choose any version which we want to work upon and it doesn't need to be the immediate previous one.

            command lines

cd(directory name)              -- is used to change the current directory
mkdir(directory name)           -- is used to create a directory
rmdir(directory name)           -- is used to remove a directory
ls                              -- lists all the contents inside the current directory
ls -a                           -- it gives the hidden files too
git init                        -- initializes an empty repository inside the directory

once the files are created in the working directory, inorder to start tracking the changes, they need to be
moved to the staging directory which is an intermediate place to choose which files in the working directory
are to be commited

to see wha tare currently inside the staging directory, the below command is helpful

git status -- this shows the untracked files inside the working directory and not yet in the staging area

inorder to add those files to the staging directory and start tracking changes, we need to use the below

git add (file name)-- to add the files to the staging area.
git add .          -- to  add all the files 

to commit these files to the staging area,

git commit -m "(message)" -- to commit the files to the local repository, along with a message - commit is nothing
                            but a save point and it is like submitting the changes now.
git log -- to see what commits were made
