# Global constant

"""Global constant is nothing but a global variable, which is not going to be modyfied again in the code and
it remains constant"""

# Mote: The naming convention for Global constants is Upper case.

"""so when ever a variable is declared in complete upper case, 
it is a global constant and should not change it in the subsequent code"""
